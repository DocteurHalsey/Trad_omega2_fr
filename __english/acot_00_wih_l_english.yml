acot_war_in_hell.13.desc: "An interesting development within the galactic climate has occurred. Apparently, someone must have made the [FallenEmpireTaskOrigin.GetName] very very angry, as they have decided to stop being dormant and have once again awakened to reclaim their lost glory."
acot_war_in_hell.13.a: "Yeah, yeah. Big deal."
acot_war_in_hell.13.b: "Well, its bound to happen eventually."

acot_war_in_hell.16.desc.phile: "You have won this war, but that is solely because the council has pressed our hands. We did not wish to utilize the full powers of our arsenals, otherwise this would be different!\n\nBut a loss is a loss. Hopefully we will not have to speak again."
acot_war_in_hell.16.desc.spirit: "Unthinkable! We have lost!?\n\nPerhaps our devotion to the gods were not strong enough. This must have been their punishments. O Great Shroud, we understand it clearly now.\n\n[Root.GetName], you have our thanks, we will strengthen our resolves and return again to war. For now, your existences will be spared. Now begone."
acot_war_in_hell.16.desc.mat: "We lost...WE LOST??? DID WE JUST LOSE TO YOU? The probability of our defeat was less than 13.337%, clearly there must be a bug in our logic calculators. Perhaps we used the wrong machines. This is not over, we will return to claim what is ours! Now, begone!"
acot_war_in_hell.16.a: "You lost to us. Now honor the claims, give us your techs."

Think again!\n\nFine, you can have one of our secrets, not like your inferior intellects can make any use of it anyway. You will never defeat us if we ever went 100% serious! This was not even our final form."
acot_war_in_hell.16.b: "Not so fast, compensations must be made for this war."
acot_war_in_hell.16.b.response: "Ugh, fine. Here's your resources. Children these days, all they want is money."
acot_war_in_hell.16.c: "Uh ah. No no no, first you must be humilated. Apologize to the galaxy."

acot_war_in_hell.17.desc: "See, you plebians know nothing of warfare. The fact that you still managed to lose despite having conceived such an advanced technology is a testament to how pathetic you are. Such powers are not meant to be used by weaklings.\n\nTo ensure there will be no further mistakes, all of your leaders will be executed., and all of your technologies will now be ours to command and conquer. Your resources will be drained. Your fleets will be destroyed.\n\nConsider  yourselves lucky, our ancestors would have done much worse."

The Fallen Empire is no more."
acot_war_in_hell.19.desc: "It worked! It actually worked! In fact...it may have worked way too well...\n\nThe idiotic grandpas transported our rigged cache of technologies on board their capital and it exploded and caused a massive chain-reaction that somehow blew up their entire empire. Their decrepit and volatile Dark Matter Reactors must have been too outdated and too old to contain."
acot_war_in_hell.19.a: "What a waste of space. Good riddance."
acot_war_in_hell.19.b: "Will anyone even mourn them? They were quite annoying."

acot_war_in_hell.20.desc: "Denizens of the Galaxy, we are the [FROM.GetName] and we are here to broadcast a very important message...\n\nIn our arrogance, we have declared war upon the Galaxy's greatest champions and were pounded into submission as a result of our critical lack of skills.\n\nWe are terribly sorry to everyone for being such...such naughty old-timers. Please don't eat us...\n\nWe...we...ENOUGH OF THIS!!\n\n§Y<Sounds of breaking glasses and angry stomping>§!"
