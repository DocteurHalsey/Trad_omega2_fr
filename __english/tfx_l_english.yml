 tfx.303_desc:0 "[Root.Capital.GetName]'s new rulers governed with a calculated oppressiveness, restricting [Root.GetSpeciesName] liberties and assimilating [Root.Capital.GetName] natural resources into their empire. Dissenting [Root.GetSpeciesName] were captured and biomechanically transformed, or simply killed. A Suppression Field was activated to prevent [Root.GetSpeciesName] from breeding, another measure to control the population more effectively. Many [Root.GetSpeciesName] were assimilated into the occupational army on [Root.Capital.GetName], all of the Combine's infantry forces on [Root.Capital.GetName] consisting of trans-Human troops, augmented with Synth technology. The Uprising was a conflict fought between [Root.Capital.GetName]'s [Root.GetSpeciesName] and alien allied resistance network against the Combine Empire. Xenian aliens are also partaking as an undeclared third party, fighting against both sides. The war takes place about 20 years after the Black Mesa Incident and Seven Hour War, during the Combine's occupation of [Root.Capital.GetName].In response to the Combine's occupation, a number of escapees from the Combine's iron grip formed the Resistance, a highly decentralized, loose network of guerrillas, outlaws, spies, and citizens dedicated to overthrowing the Overwatch's rule. Unable to combat the Combine's powerful armies directly, the Resistance instead sought to undermine the Combine. The Uprising was instigated by the return of The Freeman, a [Root.GetSpeciesName] scientist who had been present at Black Mesa and become a cult like figure following their deeds at the base. Their sudden reappearance was cause for celebration amongst the citizens and the Resistance and they personally led the resistance in a massive uprising which ultimately led to the collapse of Combine rule on [Root.Capital.GetName] and destruction of their transdimensional portals. It appears for now the Combine have been unable to find a way to bridge the gap and access our universe again, but it is likely only a matter of time before they return."

Even today the work to restore [Root.Capital.GetName] is still ongoing, and the fear of the Combine returning is not far from any [Root.GetSpeciesName]'s mind."

Cars drive off the country road into the meadow, a group of young people get out carrying bottles, baskets of food, transistor radios, and cameras. They light fires, pitch tents, turn on the music. In the morning they leave. The animals, birds, and insects that watched in horror through the long night creep out from their hiding places. And what do they see? Old spark plugs and old filters strewn around... Rags, burnt-out bulbs, and a monkey wrench left behind... And of course, the usual mess. Apple cores, candy wrappers, charred remains of the campfire, cans, bottles, somebody’s handkerchief, somebody’s penknife, torn newspapers, coins, faded flowers picked in another meadow. We are those animals,\n\nOne year ago this event, called the Visitation simultaneously took place across half a dozen separate locations around [Root.Capital.GetName] over a two-day period. Neither the Visitors themselves nor their means of arrival or departure were ever seen by the local populations who lived inside the relatively small areas, each a few square kilometres, of the six Visitation Zones.

Several reconaissance teams that were sent into the Zone's managed to retrieve a cache of unknown artifacts that appear have powerful but unpredicable properties. Our researchers say given time these artifacts could potentially usher in a new golden age of technological progress.\n\nHowever news of these artifacts has created a new subclass of smugglers, dubbed 'stalkers' who enter the Zone's illegally and smuggle out artifats to be sold on the open market to the highest bidder. Along with the loss of minor artifacts the government could use for research, and the increase in crime due to these stalkers, initial reports suggest some artifacts from the Zone may cause ecological, physical, psychological and space-time distrubances that could potentially cause serious disaster if not contained. There are two factors that will increase the danger of the Zone\n\n§SStalker Organisation§!: The measure of how organised and experienced the various stalker groups are, the higher this value the more raids they will conduct on the Zone's and the more artifacts they will smuggle out\n\n§MWild Artifacts§!: The real danger, Wild Artifacts track the amount of dangerous artifacts that are currently circulating throughout the planet. While most are harmless, some of these artifacts can cause adverse events, natural disasters and if not kept in check may cause the planet to become entirely uninhabitable.\n\nWe can protect against both the §SStalkers§! and §MWild Artifacts§! by containing the Zone's directly (§YPlanetary Deposits§!), establishing a special police force to hunt down Stalkers, reinforce the Zone boarders and breakup any smuggling rings that may appear (§TPlanetary Decision§!) and research Advanced Containment and Arcane Deciphering technologies (§BTechnology§!)."
