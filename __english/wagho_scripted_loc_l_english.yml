waghomachbio:"We detected a virus that wreaks havoc to any equipment fitted with circuit boards. Especially sentient or semi-sentient robotics are affected, causing them to shut down and become irreparably damaged. We are tracking the current robotics in our empire."
waghomach:"Virus detected in multiple mainframes and is causing damage to our drone software, making them unusable. Primary purging systems were ineffective. Alternative solution is to track spread of virus across our drones and install preliminary intervention measures until solution is found."
