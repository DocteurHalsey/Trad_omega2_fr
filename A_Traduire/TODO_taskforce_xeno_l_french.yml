The war takes place about 20 years after the Black Mesa Incident and Seven Hour War, during the Combine's occupation of [Root.Capital.GetName].In response to the Combine's occupation, a number of escapees from the Combine's iron grip formed the Resistance, a highly decentralized, loose network of guerrillas, outlaws, spies, and citizens dedicated to overthrowing the Overwatch's rule. Unable to combat the Combine's powerful armies directly, the Resistance instead sought to undermine the Combine. The Uprising was instigated by the return of The Freeman, a [Root.GetSpeciesName] scientist who had been present at Black Mesa and become a cult like figure following their deeds at the base.

 mild_portal_storms:0 "Portal Storms (Mild)"
 mild_portal_storms_desc:0 "Portal Storms are a highly dangerous and destructive phenomena that consists of a blue 'wave' which resonates from a portal and moves across the landscape causing severe gravometric distortions in space-time that damage structures and geography. They are typically caused by the creation of an uncontained Resonance Cascade or collapse of a Dark Energy reactor. Directly after such a disaster these storms are common, decreasing in frequency over time."
