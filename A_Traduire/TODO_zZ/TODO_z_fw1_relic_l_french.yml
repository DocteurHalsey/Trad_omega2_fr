 z_fw1_relic_koh.101.name: "The population of the planet has been totally assimilated"
 z_fw1_relic_koh.101.desc.1: "Accompanied by a noisy girly voice, the intelligent species of the entire planet, regardless of organisms, intelligent machines, stone men or other messy existence, have become dark-haired beast-eared girls with two strands of white hair. Although we have not yet understood why these tentacled heads can assimilate even bread machines and stones, there is no doubt that the planet has no other species, and if there are, it will soon become them. But fortunately, with $z_fw_r_head_of_karyl$, we can create high-quality beast-eared girls, not like those on alien's plenets."
 z_fw1_relic_koh.101.desc.2: "Accompanied by a noisy girly voice, the intelligent species of the entire planet, regardless of organisms, intelligent machines, stone men or other messy existence, have become dark-haired beast-eared girls with two strands of white hair. Although we have not yet understood why these tentacled heads can assimilate even bread machines and stones, there is no doubt that the planet has no other species, and if there are, it will soon become them. It's really terrible, OMG, if left unattended, it may infect other worlds!"
 z_fw1_relic_koh.1011.name: "Our empire is occupied by skunks"
 z_fw1_relic_koh.1011.desc: "With the noise of a tumultuous girl, the entire empire seems to be occupied by this strange creature. We didn't understand exactly what happened, but obviously the citizens and leaders of the empire were replaced by this group of girls who looked like skunks. Despite this, they seem to inherit the memory and social position of the original species perfectly. It doesn't seem to have much impact on the empire, although it is faintly worrying."
 z_fw1_relic_koh.102.name: "This planet is polluted!"
 z_fw1_relic_koh.102.desc: "Wait, what's going on, what is this? A group of lively ... heads? The following are also covered with horrible sticky tentacles, oh my god, they actually jumped on everyone and tore everyone's heads off to replace them. What the hell is this monster?"

 z_fw1_relic_koh.20.desc: "We recently received an inexplicable recording, which was very confusing, accompanied by the girl ’s chanting laughter and the screaming of others in horror. Because its content is too weird and thrilling, we once thought it was a prank. But obviously, it seems to come from information near our home star, and it might be rewarding to send a research ship to investigate."
 z_fw1_relic_koh.21.name: "Ancient ruins"
 z_fw1_relic_koh.21.desc: "Arriving on the surface of Asteria, the team found that there were no signs of life activity. Only the huge pure white building covered with gravel and stains and the gold relief inlaid on it showed the prosperity here.\n\nWhat happened here, and what horrible disasters destroyed this magnificent city-state?\n\nSilent silence gave the expedition members an ominous hunch, but under the leadership of the captain, everyone still gathered the courage to go deep into the ruins."
 z_fw1_relic_koh.22.name: "Cursed fresco"
 z_fw1_relic_koh.22.desc: "The investigators went into the ruins with uneasiness, and they found that the civilization seemed to start to decline after some sudden religious worship. The original elaborate building was suddenly randomly filled with some kind of tentacle-like head image with paint, which seems to be the new god they worship.\n\nHowever, such a primitive and rough religious culture does not seem to be an orthodox god. Although everyone is very scared, they continue to move forward under the leadership of scientist §B[Root.GetLeaderName]§!"
 z_fw1_relic_koh.23.name: "Deep inside"
 z_fw1_relic_koh.23.desc: "§B[Root.GetLeaderName]§! Leading the investigation team into the inside of the ruins, the crew can only send intermittent messages because of the blocking of the signal. The crew on [Root.GetName] pay close attention to these messages. §B[Root.GetLeaderName]§! It seems to have found some kind of huge machine, which seems to be a seal with something buried in it, and they are trying to scan it.\n\nEverything is running as usual, and suddenly the signal becomes unstable, they seem to be in trouble. In the intermittent audio communication, we can only hear the cry of the crew's fear, scattered gunshots, and ... some kind of girlish hustle and laughter, which is really weird!"
 z_fw1_relic_koh.24.name: "Ancient machine"
 z_fw1_relic_koh.24.desc: "When the conflict subsided, the audio message suddenly became strange. The investigation team and §B[Root.GetLeaderName]§! 'S voice disappeared, replaced by a completely strange sweet girl voice, they told the crew on the track that everything was normal, no one sacrificed, except ... everyone changed Became a dark-haired cat-eared girl.\n\nAt first, the crew did not believe everything they heard. They thought that §B[Root.GetLeaderName]§! must have been absorbed and replaced by some indescribable existence. But the answers from the investigation team and §B[Root.GetLeaderName]§! Show that they seem to be themselves, regardless of character or information they know!\n\n§B[Root.GetLeaderName]§! Said the huge machine suddenly turned on, and it was indeed sealed with something in it. It was a cat ear head covered with tentacles, and this split head attacked them. As for the latter things, they also forgot.\n\n§B[Root.GetLeaderName]§! It is recommended that this head be recovered, and be quarantined and imprisoned after boarding the ship, and other matters will be returned to the Imperial Research Center for processing. The crew discussed for a long time and decided to accept her proposal. There is also good news that the investigation team accidentally obtained some boxes full of alloys and bitcoins from near the machine. These resources can be used by the empire."
 z_fw1_relic_koh.25.name: "Forgotten history"
 z_fw1_relic_koh.25.desc: "§B[Root.GetLeaderName]§! Carefully read the text engraved on the ancient machine, this is an ancient language already in the database! All the mysteries are also solved:\n\nIn ancient times, Astraia lived a group of carefree girls who built a great civilization and a splendid culture. But one day, one of them, named Kiruyi Momocha, was suddenly persecuted by others because she looked like a skunk. Everyone hated her and gave her a cursed name, Karyl.\n\nKiruyi Momocha is very angry, but she has no friends, everyone squeezes her out. So she prayed to the voice in §Hthe Abyss§! For refuge from the depths of the stars, and §Hthe Abyss§! Answered her and gave her the ability to immortalize and assimilate others.\n\nThis assimilation method is both cruel and gentle, it allows the replica of Bade Hiliuye to tear off other people ’s heads and assimilate their bodies, while retaining their original soul intact. So everyone who laughs at Bahia Siliuye will become her and retain the original memory. Eventually, when everyone was assimilated, they were unwilling to suffer such humiliation, and they all broke off themselves, and Kiruyi Momocha also sealed herself sadly."
 z_fw1_relic_koh.26.name: "Purification"
 z_fw1_relic_koh.26.desc: "A few days later, the sealing machine suddenly started again automatically, turning the planet into a heavenly Gaia world.\n\nThe curse of Kiruyi Momocha disappeared from here, and the lucky ones who were fortunate enough to listen to the history of Asteria have been rewarded by this ancient civilization.\n\nSo, are we going to purify this planet into Gaia or leave it as it is? After all, minor relic resources are very rare."
 z_fw1_relic_koh.26.a: "Purify it"
 z_fw1_relic_koh.26.b: "Leave as is"
 z_fw1_relic_koh.27.name: "Strange head"
 z_fw1_relic_koh.27.desc: "The exploration of the ruins was interrupted, a faulty operation triggered some kind of ancient defense mechanism, and the entire Astraea ruins collapsed.\n\nHowever, we did not get nothing, a strange head was sent to the research ship, we need to study well."
